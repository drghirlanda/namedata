If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through
the Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use

The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”).

*** Fee Changes
DataWorks LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

DataWorks LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

*** Refunds
Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by DataWorks LLC on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of DataWorks LLC.

** Accounts
When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above
the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate,
complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or
obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your
account on the Service.

** Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New York, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

** Changes
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at
least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole
discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become
effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not
agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the
Service.
